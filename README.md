# Customer Query Classification using NLP

## Project Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning solution for classifying customer queries using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques. The goal is to improve customer support efficiency by accurately categorizing incoming queries, enabling better routing and faster response times.

## Key Features
- **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and normalize raw customer query data by handling tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Convert textual data into numerical form using **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** to represent the importance of words across customer queries.
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Extract relevant entities (e.g., product names, locations, dates) from queries to enhance classification accuracy.
- **SVM Classifier**: A **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model is trained to classify the queries into predefined categories, with a focus on improving precision and recall.
- **Performance Improvement**: Optimized the classification pipeline to significantly boost query classification accuracy and streamline customer service operations.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, SpaCy, NLTK, Pandas
- **Machine Learning**: Support Vector Machines (SVM), TF-IDF Vectorization
- **NLP Techniques**: Named Entity Recognition (NER), Tokenization, Stop-word removal, Stemming

## Business Impact
By automating the classification of customer queries, this project enhances the efficiency of customer support teams, leading to quicker issue resolution and higher customer satisfaction. It enables the company to scale its customer support efforts without increasing operational costs.
